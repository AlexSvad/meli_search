## Getting Started

This project contains 3 flavors:

- development
- staging
- production

To run the desired flavor either use the launch configuration in VSCode/Android Studio or use the following commands:

```sh
# Development
flutter run --flavor development --target lib/main_development.dart

# Staging
flutter run --flavor staging --target lib/main_staging.dart

# Production
flutter run --flavor production --target lib/main_production.dart
```

_\*Meli Search works on Android._

## Model–view–viewmodel (MVVM) architectural pattern

This architecture was implemented throughout the project.

## Running Tests

To install lcov and run all unit and widget tests use the following command:
```sh
./run_tests.sh
```

or

```sh
$ flutter test --coverage --test-randomize-ordering-seed random
```

To view the generated coverage report you can use [lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov).

```sh
# Generate Coverage Report
$ genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/

# Open Coverage Report
$ open coverage/index.html
```

## Working with Translations

This project relies on [flutter_localizations][flutter_localizations_link] and follows the [official internationalization guide for Flutter][internationalization_link].

### Generating Translations

To use the latest translations changes, you will need to generate them:

1. Generate localizations for the current project:

```sh
flutter pub get && flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Alternatively, run `flutter run` and code generation will take place automatically.
